# Experiment 1A
To blink an LED using Arduino

## Requirements
* Arduino Uno
* Arduino IDE
* 330-ohm resistor 
* Breadboard
* Single strand wires

### Connections:
1. Take a single strand wire and connect it to one of the pins on PORTB.
2. Connect its other end to the anode of an LED on the breadboard.
3. The cathode of the LED goes to the ground pin of Arduino via a 330-ohm resistor.
### Procedure:
1. Open the Arduino IDE and paste the code given below.
2. Modify the register values according to the pin that youâ€™ve connected your LED to.
3. Compile the code and dump it on Arduino. 
4. Observe the output. 
5. Now, change the value of delay from 1000 to something smaller and observe the output.
6. Try using multiple LEDs connected on different pins. Change the code accordingly.
