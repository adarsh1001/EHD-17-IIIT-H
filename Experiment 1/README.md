# Lab 1
Before diving into the much easier Arduino style of coding, for the first two labs, we shall implement codes using AVR style so as to give students an idea of register access and manipulation on Atmega-328.  

## Experiment 1A
In this experiment, we blink an LED connected to digital pin 8 of Arduino (or PB0 of Atmega). 

## Experiment 1B
In this experiment, we interface a pushbutton to PB2 with external pull-ups and control an LED connected to PB0.

## Experiment 1C
This is a variation of Exp 1B. Instead of interfacing the pushbutton with external pull-ups, we use the internal pull-ups present on Atmega-328.
